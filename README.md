# SSVEP-face
We utilized an electroencephalography (EEG) dataset of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) in which participants were presented with human face images of different stylization levels ranging from simplistic cartoons to actual photographs.

Regarding the stimuli materials and the paradigm, please find in the reference:

Our scripts contain three major parts:

1. Classification
  Applying task-related component anaylsis to decode the perceived realness.

2. SSVEP_analysis
  Some basic analysis regarding the amplitudes of SSVEP and applying SSD.

3. Statistical analysis
   Regression between varaibles in this study.
