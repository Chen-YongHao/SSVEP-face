## SSVEP-face
We used an electroencephalography (EEG) dataset of **steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)** in which participants were presented with human face images at varying levels of **stylization(realness)**, ranging from simplistic cartoons to actual photographs. Assessing neuronal responses both in the frequency and time domain, we found a non-linear relationship between SSVEP amplitudes and stylization level, that is, the most stylized cartoon images and the real photographs evoked stronger responses than images with medium stylization. Moreover, the realness of even highly similar stylization levels could be decoded from the EEG data, suggesting a basis for future research and neuronal benchmarking of real-time detection of face realness.
